README.source for redis
=======================

We maintain our own versions of redis.conf and sentinel.conf under debian/
instead of patching.

Prior to releasing a new upstream verison, remember to run:

 $ diff -urNad redis.conf debian/redis.conf
 $ diff -urNad sentinel.conf debian/sentinel.conf

.. and incorporate any changes.
