# Example script executed ${TEXT}.
#
# All executable files within this directory are executed in lexical sort
# order. Filenames must consist entirely of ASCII upper- and lower-case
# letters, digits, underscores, and hyphens. If the script returns with a
# non-zero exit code, no further scripts are run.
#
# Example:
#
#    redis-cli SCRIPT LOAD "\$(cat /path/to/script.lua)" >/dev/null
#
# Scripts should be idempotent so that multiple calls to (eg.)
# "/etc/init.d/${PKG} start" does not result in unintended consequences.
